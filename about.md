      My name is <strong>Alex Zakharov</strong>, and I am a PhD student at the <strong>Whiteson Research Lab</strong> 
      at the University of Oxford, where I am supervised by 
      <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/" target="_blank">Prof Shimon Whiteson</a>.

      Previously, I worked as a research associate at <strong>Huawei 2012 Laboratories</strong> in London, 
      focusing on <em>Bayesian model-based RL</em>, <em>representation learning</em>, and <em>generative models</em>. 
      I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from <strong>Imperial College London</strong>, where I was 
      supervised by <a href="http://www.zfountas.com" target="_blank">Dr. Zafeirios Fountas</a> and 
      <a href="http://mdcrosby.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Matthew Crosby</a>. 
      Prior to Imperial College, I completed a Bachelor's degree at <strong>University College London</strong>, 
      where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.markmiodownik.net/" target="_blank">Prof. Mark Miodownik</a>.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I am interested in building adaptive agents that can safely navigate complex environments to achieve desired outcomes. 
      To this end, I am focused on the framework of <strong>Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning</strong>. 
      I believe it provides the natural basis for building robust and adaptive artificial agents that can deal with 
      stochastic and partially-observable environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      More specifically, my research has been dedicated to creating better world models (latent-variable generative modeling) 
      and model-based agents with Bayesian planning objectives.
