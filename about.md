My name is Alex, and I am a PhD student at the Whiteson Research Lab, University of Oxford, where I am supervised by [Prof Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/).

Previously, I worked as a research associate at Huawei 2012 Laboratories in London, focussing on *Bayesian model-based RL*, *representation learning*, and *generative models*. I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London, where I was supervised by [Dr. Zafeirios Fountas](http://www.zfountas.com) and [Dr. Matthew Crosby](http://mdcrosby.com/). Prior to Imperial College, I completed a Bachelor's degree at University College London, where I was supervised by [Prof. Mark Miodownik](http://www.markmiodownik.net/).

Here, I post information about my research projects -- check out my [**research**]({{site.url}}/research) page.
