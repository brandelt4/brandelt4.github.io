## About me

Hi and welcome to my website!

My name is Alex, and I am a Research Associate at Huawei 2012 Laboratories in London, focussing on Bayesian model-based RL, active inference, and computational neuroscience.

I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London, where I was supervised by [Dr. Zafeirios Fountas]() and [Dr. Matthew Crosby](). Prior to Imperial College, I completed a Bachelor's degree at University College London, where I was supervised by [Prof. Mark Miodownik]().

Here, I post information about my ongoing projects, ~~thoughts, and opinions~~ (not quite there yet).
